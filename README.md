## For World Creators
Follow the Collisions layers steps first before importing package!
This project can be downloaded from [The releases page](https://github.com/Xiexe/VRCBilliards/releases)
or by downloading the source, and extracting the zip into your project.

### Dependencies / Setup
- Install VRCSDK 3
- Install [Udon Sharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp)
- Import the package OR unzip the Source Code into your project into it's own folder.

#### Collision layers
There are some objects that need to be set to only collide on a seperate layer. This is very important!

Recommended steps:
- Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers
- Set User Layer 23 to: `ht8b`
- Edit > Project Settings > Physics
- In the collision matrix deselect all apart from itself for the new layer as so:

The project includes some small scripts to change / toggle stuff between quest/pc versions

It has to be manually changed


On the top of the prefab there is one:

And in the scene `__MAIN__` also has one of these scripts

### Caveats
- This project is currently not designed / tested with more than one instance of a table in a world and is currently unsupported
